# Hey there! 👋🏼

I'm a technology enthusiast with a passion for programming, user experience, and design. From prototypes and infrastructure to backends and client apps, I'm always eager to have an end-to-end understanding and bring clarity to business needs. If you're interested in collaborating on a project or discussing the latest tech trends, feel free to [connect with me](https://twitter.com/landsman).

In my free time, you can find me hanging out with [my dog](http://instagram.com/joshi.the.shiba/) or enjoying [music](https://landsman.github.io/music/), games, old sitcoms, sci-fi, youngtimer cars & EVs, Linux, and tech in general.
