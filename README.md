# Hey there! 👋🏼 

I'm a technology enthusiast with a passion for programming and a keen eye for user experience and interface design.

In my free time, you can find me spending time with [my dog](http://instagram.com/joshi.the.shiba/) or researching various frameworks, tools and the latest trends in design. I'm also interested in [music](https://www.last.fm/user/Insuit), games, old sitcoms, sci-fi, youngtimer cars & EVs, green-energy, linux, and all things geeky 😁

If you're interested in collaborating on a project or discussing the latest tech trends, feel free to [connect with me](https://twitter.com/landsman)!
