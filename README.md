# Hey there! 👋🏼

I'm a technology enthusiast passionate about programming, user experience, and design. I love working across the stack — from prototypes and infrastructure to backends and client apps — always aiming for an end-to-end understanding and clarity in solving business needs.

Tech:
- **Linux**
- **Kotlin/Java** or **PHP**
- React with Typescript or plain JS with JSDoc
- **Infrastructure as Code** is must have for me.

When I'm not coding, I’m probably hanging out with [my dog](http://instagram.com/joshi.the.shiba/), enjoying [music](https://landsman.github.io/music/), playing games, watching old sitcoms or sci-fi, or obsessing over youngtimer cars, EVs, and, of course, Linux.

If you're into any of that or just want to talk about your project, feel free to connect with me - [X](https://twitter.com/landsman) / [Bsky](https://bsky.app/profile/landsman.bsky.social).
